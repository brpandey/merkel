defmodule Merkel.Audit do
  @moduledoc """
  Module facilitates audit proof creation given the candidate key
  as well as providing verification of the proof.

  The audit proof simply contains the candidate key and the audit path
  in tuple form that eliminates any need to store an index or other overhead
  to track key position.  The construction of the tuple encodes the proper
  hash concatenation order.

  "The purpose of the Merkle tree [in Bitcoin] is to allow the data in a block
  to be delivered piecemeal: a node can download only the header of a block 
  from one source, the small part of the tree relevant to them from another 
  source, and still be assured that all of the data is correct. 

  The reason why this works is that hashes propagate upward: if a malicious 
  user attempts to swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, 
  this change will cause a change in the node above, and then a change in the 
  node above that, finally changing the root of the tree and therefore the hash 
  of the block, causing the protocol to register it as a completely different block 
  (almost certainly with an invalid proof of work)"
