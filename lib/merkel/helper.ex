  # Tree creation helpers

  # Helpers to create a balanced tree from a list of sorted k-v pairs using partitioning
  # Used on setup

  # We are able to build the leaves first of the merkle tree and then the inner structure
  # since we are using postorder traversal (leaves first then inner nodes)

  # The nice thing is the routine allows us to figure out 
  # the inner node structure in a balanced way (hence the partition divide by 2)

  # This can be represented in taking a number down to its halves for each level of
  # the tree until we get to 1

  # The children are roughly the integer halves of its parent
  # The number of leaves or 1's are equivalent to the root value (what we want :))

  #             5
  #            / \
  #           3   2
  #          / \ / \
  #         2  1 1  1
  #        / \
  #       1   1

  # So postorder traversal is 112131125
  # Exactly what we want as merkle tree key-values are stored at the leaves!

  # We thread the sorted list of values through all the 1's,
  # shrinking the list as it is consumed

  # We only create nodes until we get down to the 1's. Where we
  # we first create the leaf nodes, then when we have two leaf
  # nodes (l and r) we create the inner nodes.

  # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

  # Divide number into its whole rough halves e.g. for 5 its 3 and 2
  # By default, the left subtree is the dominant side as it gets the larger number 
  # (making it deeper)

  # We override this by specifying which side we want the bigger number to be
  # and if we want that to alternate or not if the halves differ in size
